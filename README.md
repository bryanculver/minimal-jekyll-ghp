# Minimal Theme (Now with GitHub Pages Safe Jekyll!)

*Note: I created this project before stumbling on this: [GitHub Pages Minimal Theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal). For simplicity sake, that theme is a listed supported theme which means you can just flag it in your `_config.yml` file. This theme uses a bit more templating, so feel free to contribute, fork, use whichever theme you choose.*

## Heads up! Like this theme? Want some `jekyll-assets` sauce? Don't use GitHub pages?

Then you might like this version better: [bryanculver/minimal-jekyll](https://github.com/bryanculver/minimal-jekyll)

[Demo the Theme](https://bryanculver.github.io/minimal-jekyll-ghp/)

This is the raw HTML and styles that are used for the *minimal* theme on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

Syntax highlighting is provided on GitHub Pages by [Pygments](http://pygments.org).
